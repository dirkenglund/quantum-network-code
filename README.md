# Quantum Network Simulation

This repository contains a simulation of a quantum network involving various institutions, fiber hubs, and quantum technologies.

created for CQN review 2024

## File Descriptions

- **nodes.py**: Contains definitions for nodes in the network, including their properties.
- **edges.py**: Contains definitions for links in the network, including properties like length, transmission loss, and link type.
- **main.py**: The main script that builds the network graph and creates a Folium map for visualization.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required Python packages to run the simulation.

## How to Run

1. Install the required packages using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the main script:
python main.py


3. Open the generated `boston_network_map.html` file in a web browser to view the network visualization.
